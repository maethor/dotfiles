# Grab weather data from weather.com and format it according to the given XSLT
# Script written by boojit
# Modified by Hellf[i]re
# The orignal script and xslt can be downloaded from http://pondol.com/weather.tar.gz

# Usage:
# ${execi 1800 /path/to/weather/weather.sh location}
# Usage Example:
# ${execi 1800 /home/user/weather/weather.sh 03833}

# your Location ID: use http://xoap.weather.com/search/search?where=[yourcity] to find it
# U.S. users can just use their zip code; doubt that works for anyone else though (YMMV)
LOCID=$1

# s=standard units, m=metric units
UNITS=m

# where this script and the XSLT lives
RUNDIR=/home/maethor/.conkyrc

# there's probably other stuff besides CURL that will work for this, but i haven't
# tried any others.
# you can get curl at http://curl.haxx.se/
CURLCMD=/usr/bin/curl

# get it at http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
XSLTCMD=/usr/bin/xsltproc

# you probably don't need t[b][/b]o modify anything below this point....

# CURL url. Use cc=* for current forecast or dayf=10 to get a multi-day forecast
CURLURL="http://xoap.weather.com/weather/local/$LOCID?cc=*&unit=$UNITS&dayf=2"

# The XSLT to use when translating the response from weather.com
# You can modify this xslt to your liking
XSLT=$RUNDIR/weather.xslt

#filter (if you want to convert stuff to lower-case or upper case or something)
#FILTER="|gawk '{print(tolower(\$0));}'"
